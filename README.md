# Motivation
Just watch [this video](https://youtu.be/PCBTZh41Ris)! When my friend Eli Anderson showed me this video, it BLEW MY MIND!! This paper just came out on August 22, 2018 so we're talking about literally cutting edge technology right here. That's a good enough motivation. We just wanna do cool things, right?

# Objective
Complete Drake's "In My Feelings" challenge without actually dancing

# Background (including a lot of technical stuff that I don't fully understand)
## Original Paper
Read [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.07371.pdf) very carefully and familarize yourself with GANs and basics of pose estimation. We can go over these step by step in meetings because I don't understand all of it either:+1: 
Basically, we will try to replicate what this paper did. It seems like that's very uncreative, but at least we have a clear goal. Also, the technical parts are fairly complicated so this project will be very challenging.

### Linear Algebra
You kinda need linear algebra to understand machine learning in general. [This video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) give you a great intuition.

### Videos
YouTube videos are great! [Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A) has a lot of interesting contents including GANs and human pose estimation!

# Necessary Equipment
- A lot of passion, energy, and some time (about 3-5 hours a week or more?)
- Laptop (recommended)

We have an access to really good brand new GPUs (NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti) on the basement of Roy O. West Library, so we don't have to worry about computation powers that much. Yay!

I hope everyone is excited! I try to make this project like a study session for the first half of the semester so that we have necessary knowledge about the subject before we start actually implementing the project.
